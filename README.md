## How to Play

- Click on any empty square to place your mark (X or O).
- The game alternates turns between X and O.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
